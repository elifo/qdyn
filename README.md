## A Quasi-DYNamic earthquake simulator

[![GitHub Action Status](https://github.com/ydluo/qdyn/actions/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ydluo/qdyn/actions) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ansicolortags/badge/?version=latest)](https://ydluo.github.io/qdyn/) [![GPLv3 license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://perso.crans.org/besson/LICENSE.html)

*QDYN* is a boundary element software to simulate earthquake cycles (seismic and aseismic slip on tectonic faults) under the quasi-dynamic approximation (quasi-static elasticity combined with radiation damping) on faults governed by rate-and-state friction and embedded in elastic media.

*QDYN* includes various forms of rate-and-state friction and state evolution laws, and handles non-planar fault geometry in 3D and 2D media, as well as spring-block simulations. Loading is controlled by remote displacement, steady creep or oscillatory load. In 3D it handles free surface effects in a half-space, including normal stress coupling. The medium surrounding the fault is linear, isotropic and elastic, and may be uniform or (in 2D) contain a damaged layer.

*QDYN* implements adaptive time stepping, shared-memory parallelization, and can deal with multi-scale earthquake cycle simulations with fine details in both time and space. It is equipped with user-friendly MATLAB and Python interfaces and graphical output utilities.

To get started with QDYN, see [the documentation](https://ydluo.github.io/qdyn/).
